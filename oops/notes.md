Javascript is a prototype based language 

## OOPS 

programming paradigm 

### object ; collection of properties and methods

#### Why we use 00P 

OBJECT LITERAL -> THAT MEANS OBJECTS ONLY

CONSTRUCTOR FUNCTION 

PROTOTYPE 

CLASSES 

Instances(now , this)


#### 4 Pillars

Abstraction -> Chupa lo chize
Encapsulation -> wrapping
Inheritance -> prototypes
Polymorphism -> same method will do multiple things
